# Support & Maintenance

- Issues/requests: open a ticket with repro steps, browser/OS, and screenshots where possible.
- Security: report privately via email before disclosure; do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.
- Response targets: best-effort within 2 business days; fixes prioritized by severity and customer impact.
- Compatibility: browser-based app, tested on evergreen Chrome/Firefox/Safari; no server-side rendering support.
- Releases: follow `npm run lint && npm run build` before tagging; attach changelog entries and asset export smoke tests.
